Call Me
======

Call Me is a server, written in python and flask, that redirects Twilio voice calls.

When traveling abroad I typically purchase a local cell phone.  Sadly,
these phone plans tend to be somewhat limited and very commonly don't include
any data.  If I want to communicate with folks back home I'm forced to wait
until I'm near my computer and have Internet access.  This application allows me
to call a local number and have my call forwarded elsewhere.

After this server is installed you should change your Twilio number's request URL to here.
