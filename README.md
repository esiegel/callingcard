Calling Card
======

Why use an international calling card when you now can use "Calling Card."

When traveling abroad I typically purchase a local cell phone.  Sadly,
these phone plans tend to be somewhat limited and very commonly don't include
any data.  If I want to communicate with folks back home I'm forced to wait
until I'm near my computer and have Internet access.  This application allows me
to call a local number and have my call forwarded elsewhere.

It is a server, written in Python and Flask, that forwards Twilio voice calls
to the number of your choosing.  It also allows important numbers to be added
to a "Speeddial" for quick calling.


After this server is installed you should change your Twilio number's request URL to here.
